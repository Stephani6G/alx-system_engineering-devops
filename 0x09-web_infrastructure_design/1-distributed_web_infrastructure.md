This setup provides several benefits, i    ncluding improved performance, high availability, and data redundancy.  7 What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the app    lication?
  8         Primary Node: The primary node is the main database server responsible for handli    ng read and write operations. All write operations, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE qu    eries, are directed to this primary node. It maintains the authoritative copy of the data    .
  9         Replica Nodes: Replica nodes, also called slave nodes, are copies of the primary     database. These nodes receive replicated copies of data from the primary node and are typ    ically used for read operations, such as SELECT queries. They serve to distribute read qu    eries, reducing the load on the primary node and improving performance.
